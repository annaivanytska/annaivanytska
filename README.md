## Hi there 👋

I'm a freshly graduated student who loves solving problems and building things with code. I’ve worked with C++, Golang, Python, and even Pascal (yep, still useful!). In my free time, I like working on fun side projects or reading books.

Always down to learn something new or collaborate on interesting projects!
